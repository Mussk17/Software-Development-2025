# An Introduction to Software Versioning  
## Week 2: Git Version Control & Project Initial Setup

## 2.1 Topics Covered
- Git version control basics  
- GitHub repositories  
- Project codebase folder structuring  

## 2.2 Key Learnings
I learned the core concepts of version control systems such as Git and GitHub. This included understanding commits, staging areas, branching, and remote repositories. I also learned why version control is important for collaboration, safe development, merging changes, and tracking project history.

## 2.3 Practical Implementation
I created a GitHub repository to store and manage coding projects. I organized the project using structured directories for code, documentation, and data files. I also created a `README.md` file and explored the use of a `.gitignore` file to prevent unnecessary or sensitive files from being tracked or pushed to GitHub.

## 2.4 Challenges Faced & Solutions
I faced authentication issues while synchronizing repositories with GitHub. These issues were resolved by configuring Git user credentials, setting up SSH keys, adding the keys to GitHub account settings, and configuring global Git variables.

## 2.5 Contribution to Final System
Using version control allowed safe and consistent progress across all projects. It enabled tracking changes, identifying errors, rolling back to previous versions, and maintaining a professional development workflow.
