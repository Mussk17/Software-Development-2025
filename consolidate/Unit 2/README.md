# Introduction to Software Versioning Unit 2-Consolidate 
* Git-based project

A Git-based project demonstrating the fundamentals of software versioning using Git and GitHub, including repository setup, branching, commits, and pull requests.

## What It Does
- Creates and manages a GitHub repository for software development
- Uses Git for tracking changes through commits
- Demonstrates branching and merging using pull requests
- Includes documentation using a README file
- Prevents unnecessary files from being tracked using `.gitignore`

## Requirements
- Git
- GitHub account
- Command-line interface or GitHub Desktop

## How to Use
- Clone or create the repository
- Create a new branch for making edits
- Make changes and commit them with clear messages
- Push changes to GitHub
- Open a pull request to merge changes into the main branch

## Version Control Features Used
- Repository creation and management
- Staging and committing changes
- Branch creation and comparison
- Pull requests for controlled merging
- Remote repository synchronization

## Files Included
- `README.md` – Project documentation
- `.gitignore` – Specifies files and folders to exclude from version control

## Workflow Demonstrated
- Main branch for stable content
- Feature branch for edits (`software-edits`)
- Commit history for tracking changes
- Pull request review before merging

## Project Structure
The repository is structured to keep documentation and project files organized, following standard version control best practices.
