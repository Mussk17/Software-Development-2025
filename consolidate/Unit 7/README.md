# Unit 7: Guess the Number Game - Concept of Iteration (Looping) in Programming

A Python program demonstrating loop structures through an interactive "Guess the Number" game. This program reinforces the concept of loops by showcasing their utility in scenarios where actions need to be repeated based on specific conditions.

## How to Run

```bash
python main.py
```

## Key Functions

- `generate_secret_number()` - Generates a random secret number (1-100)
- `get_user_guess()` - Prompts user for guess with input validation
- `check_guess()` - Compares guess with secret number
- `provide_feedback()` - Provides feedback (too high/too low/correct)
- `play_game()` - Main game function with loop structure
- `display_repetition_examples()` - Shows real-world examples of repetition

## Game Features

- Loop structure that repeats until correct guess or 7 attempts reached
- Input validation with error handling
- Feedback system (too high/too low hints)
- Real-world repetition examples to understand loop concepts

## Files

- `main.py` - Main program with menu and game loop
- `functions.py` - Modular functions for game operations
