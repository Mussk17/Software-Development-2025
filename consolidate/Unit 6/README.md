# Unit 6: To-Do List Manager - Exploring Functions in Python

A simple Python program demonstrating modular programming with functions. This to-do list manager breaks down functionality into separate functions for adding tasks, marking them as completed, and displaying the list.

## How to Run

```bash
python main.py
```

## Key Functions

- `get_todos()` - Reads tasks from file
- `write_todos()` - Writes tasks to file
- `add_task()` - Adds a new task
- `display_tasks()` - Shows all tasks
- `mark_completed()` - Marks a task as completed

## Commands

```
add Buy groceries      # Add a new task
show                   # Display all tasks
complete 1             # Mark task 1 as completed
exit                   # Exit the program
```

## Files

- `main.py` - Main program with user interface
- `functions.py` - Modular functions for task operations
- `todos.txt` - Stores tasks (created automatically)
